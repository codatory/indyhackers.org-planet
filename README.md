# What is this?

This is a simple RSS Aggregator for the IndyHackers.org community. It collects feeds from all over the blogosphere and puts them in one simple to collect place.

# How do I get on?

Fork the repo and add yourself to the feeds section of config.yml or open an issue. I'll verify your feed is valid enough to be included and redeploy the app.

# Where does it live?

- json: http://indyhackers-planet.herokuapp.com/posts.json
- rss: http://indyhackers-planet.herokuapp.com/posts.rss

# I just posted something and it hasn't shown up

To be nice to servers, I'm only updating the JSON and RSS every 1 hour. If your new stuff isn't showing up after an hour, open an issue and I'll look into it.
